# CLAUDE.md — [COMPANY NAME] PM Playground

## What This Is

A PM operating environment for [COMPANY NAME], built on [pm-playbooks](https://github.com/ashstep2/pm-playbooks). All skills are installed in `.claude/skills/` and auto-discovered by Claude Code.

## Running Skills

When a skill is invoked (by name or by describing a PM question):

1. **Read the skill file** from `.claude/skills/`
2. **Read all relevant `context/` files** if the directory exists. If missing or partially populated, ask the user for equivalent information conversationally — do not halt or error.
   - `context/company/` — company intel
   - `context/competitive/` — competitive landscape
   - `context/founders/` — founder profiles
   - `context/products/` — product analyses
   - `context/verticals/` — market verticals
   - `context/signals/` — auto-collected signals (see Signal Freshness below)
3. **Follow the skill's Instructions section step by step**, producing each artifact
4. **Write output** to `applied/` in the appropriate subdirectory

## Skill Chaining

After completing any skill, check `pm-playbooks/skill-graph.yaml` for the `feeds_into` list of the skill you just ran. Briefly mention which skills would logically follow and why — for example, "Customer Discovery typically feeds into User Segmentation and Measuring PMF." Ask the user if they want to run one next. Do not force chaining — it is always the user's choice.

## Signal Freshness Check

Before running any skill, check `context/signals/` for existing signal files. Look at the timestamp in each file's header:

- **If signals are less than 7 days old**: Use them as-is.
- **If signals are older than 7 days OR `context/signals/` is empty**: Ask the user if they want to refresh signals first. To refresh:
  ```bash
  cd pm-playbooks && python3 -m collectors.run --config ../signals.yaml
  ```
- **If the user declines**: Proceed without signals — skills work fine with just the manual `context/` files.
