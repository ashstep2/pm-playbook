# Vertical Market Assessment

Produces a ranked evaluation of target verticals with TAM/SAM/SOM estimates, a vertical prioritization matrix, tailored entry strategies per vertical, and a go-to-market sequencing plan.

## Core Principles

1. **Start with a beachhead market, not a total addressable market**
   "The beachhead market is a single market segment that you focus all of your resources on to gain a dominant market position. Once you have captured this market, you use it as a base to attack adjacent segments."
   -- *Bill Aulet, Managing Director of the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship and author of Disciplined Entrepreneurship* ([source](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262534628/disciplined-entrepreneurship/))

   Vertical assessment is not about finding the biggest market. It is about finding the smallest market you can dominate first, then using that dominance as a wedge into the next one. Every scoring model should penalize breadth and reward focus.

2. **Competition is for losers -- find a monopoly-shaped niche**
   "Every startup should start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small. The reason is simple: it's easier to dominate a small market than a large one."
   -- *Peter Thiel, Co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, author of Zero to One* ([source](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/234764/zero-to-one-by-peter-thiel-with-blake-masters/))

   When evaluating verticals, do not chase the largest TAM. Ask: "In which vertical can we be the only credible option?" A $50M market where you are the monopoly provider is more valuable than a $5B market where you are one of twenty.

3. **Use the bowling alley strategy to sequence market entry**
   "The idea is to knock down the first pin -- your beachhead segment -- and then use it to topple adjacent segments, each one leading to the next. This is how you cross the chasm."
   -- *Geoffrey Moore, Author of Crossing the Chasm and Inside the Tornado* ([source](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/crossing-the-chasm-3rd-edition-geoffrey-a-moore))

   Verticals are not independent choices. They form a sequence where success in one creates unfair advantage in the next. The prioritization matrix should encode adjacency and reference-ability, not just standalone attractiveness.

4. **Product-market fit means the market pulls the product out of you**
   "Product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market. You can always feel when product/market fit is not happening. The customers aren't getting value, word of mouth isn't spreading, usage isn't growing."
   -- *Andy Rachleff, Co-founder of Wealthfront and Benchmark Capital, who coined the term product-market fit based on work by Don Valentine* ([source](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html))

   The strongest signal in a vertical assessment is not market size -- it is market pull. If users in a vertical are already trying to solve the problem with workarounds, duct tape, and manual processes, you have pull. If you need to educate them that a problem exists, you do not.

5. **The next big thing will start out looking like a toy**
   "Incumbents dismiss new technologies because they appear to serve only niche, low-end markets. But the technologies improve rapidly and eventually take over the mainstream markets too."
   -- *Chris Dixon, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz* ([source](https://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy))

   When scoring verticals, include at least one that looks small or unserious today but has a steep growth trajectory. The vertical that incumbents ignore is often the one with the least competition and the most optionality.

6. **Understand the whole product before entering a market**
   "There is a gap between the marketing promise made to the customer and the ability of the shipped product to fulfill that promise. This is the whole product gap, and it must be filled for any pragmatist customer to buy."
   -- *Geoffrey Moore, applying Theodore Levitt's Whole Product Model in Crossing the Chasm* ([source](https://hbr.org/1980/01/marketing-success-through-differentiation-of-anything))

   Each vertical has its own whole product requirements. Entering a vertical means understanding not just whether your core product fits, but what ecosystem of integrations, services, compliance certifications, and support expectations must be met. Score verticals partly on whole product gap size.

7. **Value hypotheses must be validated before growth hypotheses**
   "The value hypothesis tests whether a product or service really delivers value to customers once they are using it. The growth hypothesis tests how new customers will discover a product or service."
   -- *Eric Ries, Author of The Lean Startup* ([source](https://theleanstartup.com/principles))

   In vertical assessment, resist the temptation to prioritize verticals based on growth potential (large TAM, viral characteristics) before validating that users in those verticals actually get value. A vertical with proven value and uncertain growth beats a vertical with theoretical growth and unproven value.

8. **Markets that buy, not markets that exist**
   "Markets don't buy products, people do. The most common mistake in market analysis is confusing the existence of a category with the existence of demand. You need to find the specific people who have budget, authority, need, and urgency."
   -- *Bob Moesta, Co-architect of the Jobs to Be Done framework and author of Demand-Side Sales 101* ([source](https://www.amazon.com/Demand-Side-Sales-101-Customers-Progress/dp/1544509987))

   TAM estimates are necessary but not sufficient. For each vertical, identify the specific buyer persona, the budget line item the purchase comes from, the decision-making process, and the urgency driver. A vertical with a clear buyer and budget is more actionable than one with a large diffuse opportunity.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Enumerate Candidate Verticals

List all verticals under consideration. For each, provide a one-paragraph description covering:
- The core use case your product would serve in this vertical
- The primary buyer persona (job title, company type, budget authority)
- The current solution (what they do today without your product)
- Any existing traction or signal (inbound interest, pilot customers, community mentions)

Cast a wide net at this stage. Include 6-12 candidate verticals, including at least one or two that seem small or unconventional. These will be narrowed down in subsequent steps.

**Artifact produced:** Candidate Vertical List (table with vertical name, use case, buyer persona, current solution, and existing traction signals).

### Step 2: Size Each Market (TAM / SAM / SOM)

For each candidate vertical, produce three estimates:

- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** The total revenue opportunity if every potential customer in the vertical adopted your product category. Use top-down industry reports and bottom-up unit economics to triangulate.
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):** The portion of TAM reachable with your current product scope, pricing, and geographic reach. Apply realistic filters (e.g., only companies with >50 employees, only English-speaking markets, only teams already using cloud infrastructure).
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** The portion of SAM you can realistically capture in 12-18 months given your current team, distribution, and competitive position.

For each estimate, show your math. State assumptions explicitly. Use a range (low / base / high) rather than a single point estimate to acknowledge uncertainty.

**Artifact produced:** Market Sizing Table (vertical, TAM, SAM, SOM with assumptions and ranges).

### Step 3: Score Verticals on Attractiveness Dimensions

Rate each vertical across seven dimensions on a 1-5 scale:

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| **Market Pull** | Evidence of organic demand -- inbound inquiries, workaround usage, community discussions. Are people in this vertical already trying to solve this problem? |
| **Whole Product Gap** | How much beyond your core product is needed to win (integrations, compliance, services, support)? Lower gap = higher score. |
| **Competition Intensity** | Number and strength of existing solutions. Less competition = higher score. |
| **Willingness to Pay** | Budget availability, historical spend on similar tools, and pricing sensitivity. |
| **Adjacency Value** | How much winning this vertical helps you enter the next one (reference customers, shared tech, bowling alley dynamics). |
| **Time to Revenue** | Sales cycle length, procurement complexity, and how quickly you can close first deals. |
| **Strategic Alignment** | Fit with your company mission, team expertise, and long-term vision. |

Compute a **Vertical Attractiveness Score** (weighted sum; default equal weights, adjust if the user specifies strategic priorities). Rank verticals from highest to lowest.

**Artifact produced:** Vertical Prioritization Matrix (table with dimension scores, weighted total, and rank for each vertical).

### Step 4: Select the Beachhead and Adjacent Sequence

From the ranked list, select:

- **Beachhead vertical** -- the single vertical to attack first. This should be the highest-scoring vertical that also satisfies: (a) SOM is achievable with current resources, (b) market pull is demonstrably present, and (c) winning here creates reference-ability for at least two adjacent verticals.
- **Bowling alley sequence** -- the ordered list of 2-4 subsequent verticals to enter, with the rationale for each transition. For each adjacency, explain: what capabilities carry over, what new capabilities must be built, and what reference customer from the prior vertical unlocks credibility in the next.

Draw the bowling alley diagram as a text-based flow showing the beachhead pin and the sequence of adjacent pins it topples.

**Artifact produced:** Beachhead Selection Memo and Bowling Alley Sequence Diagram.

### Step 5: Design Entry Strategy per Vertical

For the beachhead and the first two adjacent verticals, produce a one-page entry strategy covering:

- **Positioning statement** (Aulet/Dunford format): "For [target buyer] in [vertical] who [unmet need], [product] is a [category] that [key differentiator] unlike [current alternative]."
- **Go-to-market motion**: Which of the following dominates? Direct sales, product-led growth, partner/channel, community-led, or developer evangelism? Justify the choice based on the vertical's buying behavior.
- **First 5 target accounts or communities**: Name specific companies, teams, or developer communities to approach first.
- **Whole product requirements**: What must be built, integrated, or certified beyond the core product to be credible in this vertical?
- **Win condition**: What does "we have won this vertical" look like in 12 months? Define in terms of customers, revenue, market share, or mindshare.

**Artifact produced:** Entry Strategy Brief for each selected vertical (saved as `applied/vertical-entry-{vertical-name}.md`).

### Step 6: Build the Go-to-Market Sequencing Timeline

Combine the beachhead and adjacent verticals into a single time-sequenced plan:

| Quarter | Vertical | Key Milestones | Investment Required | Risk / Dependency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1-Q2 | Beachhead vertical | First 5 paying customers, case study published | Core product + 1 integration | Market pull must validate |
| Q3-Q4 | Adjacent vertical 1 | First 3 paying customers, reference from beachhead | New integration + compliance cert | Beachhead case study needed |
| Q5-Q6 | Adjacent vertical 2 | ... | ... | ... |

Include explicit gate criteria between phases: what must be true before you invest in the next vertical? Avoid the common failure mode of entering vertical 2 before vertical 1 is truly won.

**Artifact produced:** Go-to-Market Sequencing Timeline with gate criteria.

### Step 7: Compile the Vertical Market Assessment

Assemble all artifacts from Steps 1-6 into a single document:

1. Executive Summary (one paragraph: which verticals, in what order, and why)
2. Candidate Vertical List (Step 1)
3. Market Sizing Table (Step 2)
4. Vertical Prioritization Matrix (Step 3)
5. Beachhead Selection and Bowling Alley Sequence (Step 4)
6. Entry Strategy Briefs (Step 5)
7. Go-to-Market Sequencing Timeline (Step 6)
8. Key assumptions and risks
9. Recommended immediate next actions (top 3)

**Artifact produced:** Complete Vertical Market Assessment (saved as `applied/vertical-market-assessment-{product}.md`).

## Diagnostic Questions

1. **Do you have existing customers or users in any of these verticals today?** If yes, start there -- existing traction is the strongest signal. If no, which vertical has the shortest path to a first paying customer?

2. **Can you name 5 specific people in the beachhead vertical who would take a call with you this week?** If not, you may be evaluating verticals from too far away. Do customer discovery first (use the `customer-discovery` skill) before committing to a vertical.

3. **What is the current solution in each vertical, and how painful is it?** The best beachhead verticals are ones where the current workaround is expensive, error-prone, or deeply frustrating. If the status quo is "good enough," entry will be slow regardless of market size.

4. **Which vertical would give you the best reference customers for all other verticals?** This is the adjacency question. A beachhead that unlocks no bowling alley is a dead end; a beachhead that unlocks three adjacent verticals is a growth engine.

5. **What would need to be true about your product for a buyer in each vertical to choose you over the incumbent?** This forces honesty about whole product gaps. If the answer requires capabilities you cannot build in 6 months, deprioritize that vertical.

6. **Are you confusing a large TAM with a real opportunity?** A $10B TAM means nothing if no one in that market is actively looking for a solution. Pressure-test every market size estimate with evidence of demand, not just evidence of economic activity.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Chasing the largest TAM instead of the most winnable market**
   Large TAMs attract large competitors, require expensive go-to-market motions, and demand broad product functionality. Early-stage companies that chase large TAMs spread themselves thin and get outspent by incumbents. Pick the smallest market you can dominate, then expand. The $50M market with no credible competitor is almost always the better beachhead than the $5B market with ten.

2. **Evaluating verticals in isolation rather than as a sequence**
   A vertical that scores well on standalone attractiveness but has no adjacency to your next target market is a strategic dead end. Always evaluate verticals as a bowling alley -- the value of the beachhead is partly determined by what it unlocks next. Geoffrey Moore's entire framework depends on sequencing, not just selection.

3. **Skipping the whole product analysis**
   Teams consistently underestimate what it takes to be credible in a new vertical. Entering healthcare without HIPAA compliance, entering financial services without SOC 2, or entering enterprise without SSO is not a product decision -- it is a decision to lose. Map the whole product gap before committing resources.

4. **Treating market sizing as a one-time exercise**
   TAM/SAM/SOM estimates are hypotheses, not facts. They should be updated quarterly as you gather real data from the beachhead. The most dangerous version of this mistake is anchoring on an optimistic SOM estimate and failing to update it when early traction contradicts it.

5. **Entering multiple verticals simultaneously**
   The temptation to "test" three verticals at once is strong, especially under board pressure to show growth. Resist it. Splitting a small team across multiple verticals guarantees you will be mediocre in all of them. The gate criteria between phases in the sequencing timeline exist to prevent this. Do not open the gate until the prior vertical is won.

## Context Integration

This skill draws from the `context/` directory when available. Here is how each subdirectory feeds into the analysis:

| Context Directory | Steps Used In | What It Provides |
|---|---|---|
| `context/verticals/` | Steps 1, 2, 3, 4 | Pre-existing vertical profiles with market data, buyer personas, and use cases. If vertical files already exist, use them as the starting point for the Candidate Vertical List rather than starting from scratch. Update market sizing with any data already captured. |
| `context/products/` | Steps 3, 5 | Product descriptions, pricing, and technical capabilities. Essential for scoring Whole Product Gap and Strategic Alignment in the prioritization matrix, and for writing positioning statements in entry strategies. |
| `context/competitive/` | Steps 2, 3 | Competitor landscape and per-competitor analyses. Informs Competition Intensity scoring and helps identify which verticals are underserved vs. saturated. Per-competitor files may reveal which verticals competitors are prioritizing. |
| `context/company/` | Steps 4, 5, 6 | Funding, team size, go-to-market resources, and growth stage. Calibrates the ambition of the sequencing timeline and determines how many verticals can be pursued in parallel (usually: one). |
| `context/founders/` | Steps 5, 7 | Founder backgrounds and domain expertise. Informs which verticals the team has natural credibility in -- domain expertise is a form of Cornered Resource that accelerates entry. |
| `context/signals/` | Steps 1, 3 | Auto-collected signals from GitHub, Hacker News, Reddit, and news. [SIGNAL] tagged. Use community discussions to gauge Market Pull and identify verticals where organic demand is emerging. Check freshness before citing. |

If no `context/` directory is present, the skill will ask the user to provide:
1. A brief description of their product and its core capabilities
2. A list of verticals they are considering (even rough guesses)
3. Any existing customer or user traction by vertical
4. Their current team size and go-to-market resources
